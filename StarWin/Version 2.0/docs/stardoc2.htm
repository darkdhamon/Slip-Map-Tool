in <BR>color. 
<P>-<B>Chunk</B>:a small airless world less than 1000 km in diameter. 
<P>-<B>Desert</B>:a planet with an atmosphere but without liquid

<BR>(Example: Saturne) 
<P>-<B>Glacier</B>:a planet with an atmosphere and a heavy overburden of ice.

(Example: <BR>Venus) 
<P>-<B>Ice Ball</B>:a plain ball of frozen gases. (Example: Pluto) 
<P>-<B>Icy</B>: asteroid belt composed mainly of dirty ice-balls of frozen 
water, ammonia <BR>and methane. They could be used as a source of hydrogen fuel. 
They vary in <BR>color from bright white to dull black, depending on the 
impurities mixed in with <BR>the ice. 
<P>-<B>Jungle</B>:a world with a hospitable environment entierly covered by 
jungles <BR>and swamps. 
<P>-<B>Nickel-Iron</B>: asteroid belt composed mainly of nickel and iron. These 
planetoids <BR>rich in minerals are typically a medium gray in color. 
<P>-<B>Ocean</B>:a world with a hospitable environment with more than 90 % of 
liquid <BR>water. 
<P>-<B>Post Garden</B>: a world which has a history of life, but which has since 
<BR>developed a greenhouse effect. (Example: Earth eons from now) </P>
<P>-<B>Pre Garden</B>: a planet in the life zone that has the prerequisites for 
<BR>life, given sufficent time, life will evolve on the world, shifting <BR>the 
atmosphere from methane and water vapor to nitrogen and oxygen. <BR>(Example:

atmosphere. <BR>(Example:Earth) 
<P>-<B>Tundra</B>: a world with a hospitable environment, a large portion of 
<BR>water is locked by surface frost. Tundra conditions could be <BR>described 
as cold arid planet. 
<P><B><FONT color=#0000ff>Unusual Planet Characteristics</FONT></B> 
<P>-<B>Atmospheric Contaminants</B>: the atmosphere is polluted with various 
gases <BR>or dust. 
<P>-<B>Climatic Vortex</B>: the planet has a stationary vortex, it's like a 
permanent <BR>cyclone. 
<P>-<B>Cloud Cover</B>: the planet has a permanent cloud cover over its entire 
surface; <BR>it probably rains most of the time. 
<P>-<B>Corrosive Atmosphere</B>: a concentrated gas mix creates a corrosive 
<BR>environment, which requires the use of protective suit. 
<P>-<B>Extreme Axial Tilt</B>: the planet's axis is tilted closer to the plane 
of the <BR>ecliptic than Earth's. There will be extreme variation in 
seasons,with <BR>bitter cold temperatures in winter and searing heat in summer. 
<P>-<B>Extreme Vulcanism</B>: the planetary crust is unstable either because the 
<BR>planet is still young or due to a gravitational factor like an oversize 
<BR>moon. 
<P>-<B>High Humidity</B>: (only for worlds with water) high humidity at high 
<BR>temperatures can prove to be uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous,it's 
<BR>like living in a steam bath. 
<P>-<B>High Population</B>: this planet is inhabited by 100 million or more 
people. 
<P>-<B>High Radiation Level</B>: this world has a radiation level much higher 
than <BR>Earth-normal. This could be due to several factors: a thin atmosphere, 
<BR>radioactive minerals or a nuclear war. 
<P>-<B>High Tides</B>: a large, close moon or sun produces extremely high tides. 

<P>-<B>Holy Site</B>: the world hosts a site considered as holy by one or more 
religions. 
<P>-<B>Insidious Atmosphere</B>: the atmosphere is similar to a corrosive 
atmosphere, <BR>but extreme conditions cause the corrosive effects to defeat any 
<BR>protective measures in 2 to 12 hours. 
<P>-<B>Low Humidity</B>: (only for world with water) at high temperatures will 
cause <BR>rapid drying of mucus membranes,dehydration and eventually delirium. 
<P>-<B>Meteors Storms</B>: the planet suffers frequent meteor storms, often 
including <BR>large asteroid or comet impacts, making the planet's surface a 
dangerous <BR>place. 
<P>-<B>Microbes</B>: unusual micro-organisms are present in the atmosphere.This 
could <BR>cause several different results, the most common is the presence of 
<BR>diseases. 
<P>-<B>Native Intelligent Lifeforms</B>: the planet has a native sentient life 
form, <BR>which may or may not have advanced technology. 
<P>-<B>Native Semi-Intelligent Lifeforms</B>: the planet has a native life form 
which <BR>is not fully sentient yet, but comes close, and may develop further 
(dinosaurs, <BR>mammals). 
<P>-<B>No Axial Tilt</B>: the world's axis is perpendicular to the plane of 
ecliptic. <BR>Therefore,there are no seasonal weather changes. 
<P>-<B>Orbital Conjunction</B>: a body in the system passes close enough to the 
world <BR>to cause any one of a number of effects (extreme vulcanism,tidal waves 
...) <BR>Such a conjunction would happen rarely,occuring only once in a matter 
or <BR>decades or even centuries. 
<P>-<B>Orbital Eccentricity</B>: the planet has an erratic orbit,such a world 
would <BR>combine the result of extreme axial tilt and extreme vulcanism with 
extreme <BR>variation in temperature. 
<P>-<B>Primitive Lifeforms</B>: this world hosts primitive native lifeforms 
(amphibians; <BR>ferns, polyps, plants...). 
<P>-<B>Proto-Organisms</B>: this world hosts very simple native lifeforms 
(mushrooms, <BR>algae, bacteria). 
<P>-<B>Remains of a Dead Civilization</B>: this world has remains of a long gone 
<BR>civilization (city ruins...). 
<P>-<B>Recent City Ruins</B>: this world surface has the scars of a recent 
planetary <BR>conflict. 
<P>-<B>Retrograde Rotation</B>: like Venus the rotation is in a retrograde 
movement. 
<P>-<B>Roche World</B>: the twin satellite is at the Roche's point, the minimum 
orbit <BR>distance between two planets. 
<P>-<B>Rugged Terrain</B>: the planet's land surface is almost entirely covered 
with <BR>mountains and rough, rocky terrain, with practically no flat plains or 
<BR>rounded hills. 
<P>-<B>Space Cemetery</B>: there are remains of a fantastic space battle 
orbiting this world. 
<P>-<B>Strong Magnetic Field</B>: this world has a strong magnetic field,an 
effect <BR>that can have consequences in the biological makeup of the natives. 
<P>-<B>Tidal Lock</B>: the world's period of revolution about its primary 
coincides <BR>exactly with its period of rotation on its axis; that is,its year 
is the <BR>same length as the day. The consequence is that one side of the world 
will <BR>always be turned toward the sun. 
<P>-<B>Twin World</B> : the planet has a satellite which is its perfect twin. 
<P>-<B>Unstable Climate</B>: the climate undergoes severe and unpredictable 
changes <BR>from year to year. 
<P>-<B>Unstable Planet</B>: the planet is fatally unstable and it might be in 
danger <BR>of blowing up in the forseable future. 
<P>-<B>Violent Storms</B>: this could be dust or sand storms on arid or desert 
planets, <BR>a frontal activity between well defined climate belts ... 
<P>-<B>Wonder of the Galaxy</B>: this world hosts a marvelous construction well 
known in <BR>the sector (and even galaxy).

<P>Star types range through a variety of spectral types using the codes <BR>O B 
A F G K M. These letters indicate in descending order the temperature <BR>of the 
stars. (A mnemonic for remembering this sequence is 'Oh, Be A Fine <BR>Girl, 
Kiss Me'). 
<P>The spectral type for stars is usually further specified by a decimal 
<BR>classification (using the digits 0 to 9). Thus a type F1 star is one-tenth 
<BR>of the way between F and G. All stars are treated this way with the 
<BR>exception of dwarf stars, which do not have decimal classification.

<P>-<B>Effects of eccentricity</B>: the eccentricity of the orbit will cause

<P>-<B>Maximum increase</B>: the maximum increase in temperature during the 
summer.

<P>The <B>Boiling Point</B> is the boiling point of water at the planet surface. 

<P>Note that temperature varies with latitudes (cooler in the poles, hotter

<P>Tidal locked worlds are very particular, the average temperature applies 
<BR>to the twillight region between the world's light and dark side, the day 
<BR>temperature to the lightside and the night temperature to the darkside. 
<BR>The world type applies to the twillight region. So if a tidal locked 
<BR>world is considered an Ocean world with a 90 % hydrography, it only 
<BR>applies to the twillight region and not the whole planet. 
<P>The darkside and lightside world type will varies depending on the 
<BR>maximum/minimum temperature and the atmosphere type. A world could be 
<BR>considered like Desert with its lightside and Glacier with its darkside.
