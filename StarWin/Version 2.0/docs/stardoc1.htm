<P>Star is a stellar system generator for Sci-Fi GameMasters . It populates a 
sector of space with star systems and <BR>their planets, satellites and even 
native alien races. Each astral body created is richly detailed (average surface 
<BR>temperature, night variation temperature, mineral resources, percentage of 
clouds in the atmosphere, atmosphere <BR>composition...). It's a generic program 
that could be used with any game system. <BR>Datas created could be consulted as 
ASCII files or through a browser (Star Browser). <BR>Source of inspirations 
includes Sci-Fi role-playing games ( 2300AD, MegaTraveller, Space Opera, DC 
Heroes...) <BR>some computer programs like Accrete or Galactic, and of course 
astronomy books.

<B><FONT color=#0000ff><br>History</FONT></B> 
<UL>
<LI><B>v1.0</B> : the original release 
<LI><B>v1.1</B> : added three new unusual characteristics (unstable planets,high 
humidity,low humidity),fixed two bugs (effective luminosity of two stars and the 
width of asteroid belt) and changed the determination of unusual 
characteristics. 
<LI><B>v1.2</B> : added gaia parameter and alien generator. 
<LI><B>v1.21</B>: fixed a bug in luminosity calculation. 
<LI><B>v1.3</B> : added new descriptions for moons,filename extension for the 
log file,alien descriptions are now in the same file as the system log 
file,mineral resources are divided in 5 different categories, four new alien 
government types. 
<LI><B>v1.4</B> : used objects programming (mainly for future addons),fixed a 
bug on star creation (stars with no spectral class). 
<LI><B>v1.41</B>: all datas created are now stored in different files that could 
be used easily by other programs (like the Star Browser): star.pln (planets 
datas), star.sun (systems datas), star.mon (satellites datas) and star.aln 
(alien datas), log file names changed (they could be easily deleted now without 
risking deleting all the important datas/executables). 
<LI><B>v1.5</B> : all datas created are stored in a different directory 
(/data),fixed some minor bugs,add new features (see what's new),there's no more 
log file for a star system (use Starlog for a specific log file), new method for 
mineral ressources calculation. 
<LI><B>v1.51</B>: pulsars and black holes are now a little less frequent, 
luminosity and mass are now the same for all white dwarfs, fixed a bug that 
lower the number of planets around single stars, standard atmospheres are now 
less frequent on low gravity worlds, fixed a bug with secondary stars brighter 
than primary. 
<LI><B>v1.52</B>: fixed an another bug that lower the number of planets around 
stars, companion distance from supergiant primary is higher now. 
<LI><B>v1.53</B>: some code cleaning (really useful), use of units to make 
easier code updates and reading, some changes in luminosity, gravity and astral 
body rotation computations to accommodate with Earth system datas, a bug with no 
water on Desert worlds fixed (ice could exist on these worlds). 
<LI><B>v1.53a</B>: minor changes and minor bugs fixed, some changes in random 
factor for unusual characteristics determination, but the main change is for 
effective luminosity computation of binary and tertiary systems. 
<LI><B>v1.54</B>: rings abscence bug fixed, giant gases temperature bug fixed, 
new method for determining planet temperature (based on the albedo, pressure and 
atmosphere), new planet characteristics (albedo, clouds fraction, ice fraction, 
smallest molecular weight retained, polar temperature, equatorial temperature, 
boiling point of water, orbital inclination, and magnetic field), 3 new planet 
types (pre-garden, post-garden, tundra), 3 new unusual characteristics (twin 
worlds,roche worlds and climatic vortex), no more fluorine atmospheres, new 
atmospheric components (Methane/Water vapor, Hydrogen Peroxyde/Nitrogen,Nitric 
Acid/Carbon Dioxyde, Hydrogen Peroxyde/Hydrogen Sulfide,Nitrogen/Sulfuric Acid). 

<LI><B>v1.55 beta</B>: Windows version, Star Generator, Alien Generator, Alien 
Logfile, Star Logfile and Sector Generator merged into the same program. 
<LI><B>v1.55 beta 2</B>: fix the error when clicking on the Alien Gen button 
(temporary file missing), spatial age attribute higher for TL7+ race. 
<LI><B>v1.56</B> : full 32-bit version, 35 new alien special abilities, rpg 
system conversion tool for Alternity, Battlelords of the 23<SUP>rd</SUP> century

number raised from 65557 to 2147483647, maximum sector size raised to 90,
